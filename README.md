# Drum-Kit
Drum Kit created using Javascript

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the JavaScript code:

js
Copy code
const drums = [
  { key: 'w', sound: new Audio('sounds/tom-1.mp3') },
  { key: 'a', sound: new Audio('sounds/tom-2.mp3') },
  { key: 's', sound: new Audio('sounds/tom-3.mp3') },
  { key: 'd', sound: new Audio('sounds/tom-4.mp3') },
  { key: 'j', sound: new Audio('sounds/snare.mp3') },
  { key: 'k', sound: new Audio('sounds/crash.mp3') },
  { key: 'l', sound: new Audio('sounds/kick-bass.mp3') },
];
This creates an array of objects, where each object represents a drum element on the page. The object has two properties: key, which is the keyboard key that triggers the sound, and sound, which is an Audio object that represents the sound to be played.

js
Copy code
function playSound(sound) {
  sound.currentTime = 0;
  sound.play();
}
This function takes an Audio object as a parameter, sets its currentTime property to 0 (so that it always starts from the beginning), and plays the sound.

js
Copy code
document.querySelectorAll('.drum').forEach((drum, i) => {
  drum.addEventListener('click', () => {
    playSound(drums[i].sound);
    drum.classList.add('pressed');
    setTimeout(() => {
      drum.classList.remove('pressed');
    }, 100);
  });
});
This code selects all elements with the .drum class on the page, and adds a click event listener to each one. When a drum element is clicked, it triggers the playSound function with the corresponding sound from the drums array. It also adds the .pressed class to the element, which triggers a visual feedback animation (as defined in the CSS code). Finally, it removes the .pressed class after a short delay (100ms) using the setTimeout function.

js
Copy code
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
  const drum = drums.find((d) => d.key === event.key);
  if (drum) {
    playSound(drum.sound);
    const button = document.querySelector(`.drum[data-key="${drum.key}"]`);
    button.classList.add('pressed');
    setTimeout(() => {
      button.classList.remove('pressed');
    }, 100);
  }
});
This code adds a keydown event listener to the document, which triggers whenever a key on the keyboard is pressed. It uses the find method to search for a drum object in the drums array that has a key property matching the pressed key. If a match is found, it triggers the playSound function with the corresponding sound from the drums array. It also selects the corresponding drum element on the page using a CSS selector, and adds the .pressed class to it (which triggers the visual feedback animation). Finally, it removes the .pressed class after a short delay (100ms) using the setTimeout function.

That's it! This JavaScript code creates a drum kit that can be played by clicking on the drum elements or pressing keys on the keyboard. It also adds a visual feedback animation to the drum elements to give the user a better experience.


Create a drum kit with more drum sounds and buttons.

Create a keyboard synthesizer that produces different sounds when different keys are pressed.

Create a music player that plays songs based on user input.

Create a simple game where the player has to press keys in the correct sequence to progress through levels.

Create an animation that responds to user input, such as a bouncing ball that changes direction when a key is pressed.

Create a soundboard that allows users to play various sounds and effects.

Create a quiz game where users have to answer questions by pressing keys on their keyboard.

These challenges will help you practice and improve your JavaScript skills, especially when it comes to event handling and working with audio and animations. Good luck!
